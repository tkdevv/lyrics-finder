## Lyric Finder Web App.

A React JS web app to help you find lyrics of all your favourite songs. It's as easy to use as it is on the eye.

### API

For the lyrics I interfaced with the https://api.lyrics.ovh API. I attain the content by sending a fetch request with the appropriate parameters, using a custom hook `useFetchLyrics`, it then returns the lyrics in JSON format.

### `App.js`

The component tree is rooted on App.js.
